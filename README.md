# Supply-chain-demand-forecasting
This project is a modified implementation of the Walmart Sales Forecasting project originally found on Kaggle. The original project was done using pandas for data preprocessing and analysis. In my implementation, I have made several changes, and used PySpark to handle the data processing.

# Project Overview
The goal of this project is to predict Walmart's weekly sales for various stores and departments.
